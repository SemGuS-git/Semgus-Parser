# SemGuS-Parser
A C# parsing library for SemGuS problems. We also provide a standalone tool for verifying and converting
SemGuS files.

## Usage

```
SemgusParser [--format <format>] [--mode <mode>] [--output <filename>] -- <input.sem> ...
```
Passing `-` as the input filename (or not supplying any filenames) makes the tool read from standard input.

# Format Verification
Run the tool with a format of `verify` to perform a syntax verification. Note that this option is the default.
It will additionally print out the problem information, which can be checked for correctness. This output
format is not designed to be machine readable; use the JSON output format instead.

# JSON Converter
The `SemgusParser` project contains a utility that reads in a SemGuS file and produces JSON data representing
the problem, usable by other non-.NET tools that cannot directly link with this library.

## Usage

```
SemgusParser --format json [--mode stream|batch] [--output <filename.json>] -- <input.sem> ...
```
Passing `-` as the input filename (or not supplying any filenames) makes the tool read from standard input.

The two modes, `stream` and `batch`, alter the output format of this tool. In `stream` mode (the default),
the output is a stream of newline-delimited JSON objects representing parsing events. This is suitable for
interactive mode, or when the output of this tool is being directly piped to the consuming process. In
`batch` mode, the output is a JSON array, with each item in the array being a parsing event object. This format
is suitable for outputting to a file as a complete JSON datatype. Note that the event object format is identical
between these two modes; only the output structure differs.

In stream mode:
```
{ ...event 1... }
{ ...event 2... }
{ ...event 3... }
.
.
.
```

In batch mode:
```
[
  { ...event 1... },
  { ...event 2... },
  { ...event 3... },
  .
  .
  .
]
```

## Event object format
Each event object has two fields that denote what type of event it represents: `$event` and `$type`. The `$event`
field holds the name of the particular event. The `$type` field denotes the general type of event: currently, either

* `semgus`, for a SemGuS-specific event
* `smt`, for a general SMT-LIB2 event
* `meta`, for metadata about the problem

### `meta` events
#### `set-info`
Holds general metadata about the problem. The `<value>` is either a string, number, or list of values (which might be lists, strings, numbers, etc.).
```
{ "$event": "set-info", "$type": "meta", "keyword": "<key>", "value": <value> }
```
#### `set-info`
Sent at the end of the event stream.
```
{ "$event": "end-of-stream", "$type": "meta" }
```

### `semgus` events
#### `check-synth`
Signals that the synthesizer should perform synthesis with the information provided in previous events.
```
{ "$event": "check-synth", "$type": "semgus" }
```
#### `declare-term-type`
Declares that a particular symbol will be used as a term type. Does not contain the actual term type definition.
```
{ "$event": "declare-term-type", "$type": "semgus", "name": "<term-type-name>" }
```
#### `define-term-type`
Defines a set of constructors for a term type. All term types referenced will have been previously declared by a `declare-term-type` event.
```
{ "$event": "define-term-type", "$type": "semgus", "name": "<term-type-name>", "constructors": [ <constructors> ] }
```
Each constructor (a.k.a. operator) has the form:
```
{ "name": "<constructor-name>", "children": ["<term-type>", ...] }
```
Example:
```
{
  "name": "E",
  "constructors": [
    {
      "name": "$x", "children": []
    },
    {
      "name": "$y", "children": []
    },
    {
      "name": "$0", "children": []
    },
    {
      "name": "$1", "children": []
    },
    {
      "name": "$+", "children": ["E", "E"]
    },
    {
      "name": "$ite", "children": ["B", "E", "E"]
    }
  ],
  "$event": "define-term-type",
  "$type": "semgus"
}
```
#### `chc`
An individual constrained Horn clause generated by the problem.
```
{"head": <head-rel>, "bodyRelations":[<body-rels>...], "inputVariables":["<var>"...], "outputVariables":["<var>"...], "variables":["<var>"...],"constraint": <term>, "constructor": <constructor>,"$event":"chc","$type":"semgus"}
```
Where each semantic relation has the form:
```
{"name":"E.Sem","signature":["E","Int","Int","Int"],"arguments":["et","x","y","r"]}
```
The constructor has the form:
```
{"name":"<name>","arguments":["<var>"...],"argumentSorts":["<sort>"...],"returnSort":"<sort>"}
```
Terms have the general form:
```
{ "$termType": "<type>", ... }
```
Term types include `application`, `exists`, `forall`, and `variable`. Literals are simply a literal string or number.
An example term:
```
{"name":"=","returnSort":"Bool","argumentSorts":["Int","Int"],"arguments":[{"name":"r","sort":"Int","$termType":"variable"},{"name":"y","sort":"Int","$termType":"variable"}],"$termType":"application"}
```
Example:
```
{"head":{"name":"E.Sem","signature":["E","Int","Int","Int"],"arguments":["et","x","y","r"]},"bodyRelations":[],"inputVariables":["x","y"],"outputVariables":["r"],"variables":["et","x","y","r"],"constraint":{"name":"=","returnSort":"Bool","argumentSorts":["Int","Int"],"arguments":[{"name":"r","sort":"Int","$termType":"variable"},{"name":"y","sort":"Int","$termType":"variable"}],"$termType":"application"},"constructor":{"name":"$y","arguments":[],"argumentSorts":[],"returnSort":"E"},"$event":"chc","$type":"semgus"}
```
#### `constraint`
A Boolean predicate term.
```
{ "$event": "constraint", "$type": "semgus", "constraint": <term> } 
```
The term is defined as above.
#### `synth-fun`
Contains the name of the function to synthesize, as well as the concrete grammar being used.
```
{ "$event": "synth-fun", "$type": "semgus", "grammar": <grammar>, "name": "<name>", "termType": "<name>" }
```
The grammar object is defined as:
```
{ "nonTerminals": [ {"name": "<name>", "termType": "<name>"}, ...], "productions": [<production>...] }
```
Each production object is:
```
{ "instance": "<nt-name>", "operator": "<op-name>", "occurrences": ["<nt-name>"] }
```
Note that an occurrence will be `null` if it is not a non-terminal in the operator constructor, i.e. a discovered constant.
